                <p>
                    Since this land is full of history, adventure, fantastic tastes, and views; it is difficult to choose among them for a specific time at Cappadocia. Nonetheless, if you are ready for a memorable long weekend or a honeymoon, let us help you to decide.
                    In most places, it is advised to start a day with a full breakfast. But if you are in Cappadocia, a place that offers you one of the most fantastic views of the world, we suggest you wake up at dawn and see or board one of the hot-air balloons, to view Cappadocia’s magical landscape and its famous fairy chimneys in the light of the rising sun. While the sun is rising, you will be mesmerized by the play of the sun rays around the magical surroundings.
                    After this visual show, you can enjoy a delicious Turkish breakfast for a fuel. Then you will be ready to truly discover Cappadocia!
                    Uçhisar Castle is the highest point for a panoramic view of Cappadocia, and it is one of the best points for a beginning. This giant natural castle offers you an overview of Göreme, Avanos, Çavuşin, Ortahisar and Pigeon Valley which are among the most popular places to visit. 
                    The next destination is Göreme Open-Air Museum. The Museum has been on the UNESCO World Heritage List since 1985 and it is famous for carved churches dating back to the early periods of Christianity. You can see so many remnants of the monasteries, frescoes from the Bible and be amazed by the fact that some of these are more than 1.600 years old. Do not forget to visit Karanlık and Tokalı Churches! These are the most famous and well-protected churches of Göreme Open-Air Museum.
                    You can have your lunch at Avanos with many local options. The tasty clay pot kebab, beans, soups, pumpkin desert, halva, and local wines… We do not have enough space to list all the mouth-watering options here. After the lunch, you can visit a pottery atelier and choose a souvenir for yourself or your loved ones. You can even try to make your own pottery here!
